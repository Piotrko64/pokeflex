## Game mechanics

In order to win the game, you have to defeat all enemy pokemons. It is simple.

### Example of pokemon

 Each pokemons have different stats which will be good depending on the situation. For example: SQUIRTLE has a lot hp and defense. If an enemy pokemon attacks your pokemon that has 0 defense points, the enemy pokemon activates a bonus depending on its type. Fortunately, SQUIRTLE is safe in this matter until it has 0 points of defense. Remember that the attacked pokemon always loses 1 defense point. The water type is an unusual type because when it attacks an opponent with no defense points, all your other pokemons get +1 hp. Remember that even in combat, you can consult the guide to see what the stats and picks do
